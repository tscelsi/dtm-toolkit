1997,"Domestic coal demand rises by 197 million tons in the forecast, from 959 million tons in 1995 to 1,156 million tons in 2015 (Figure 105), because of growth in coal use for electricity generation. Coal demand in other domestic end-use sectors increases by 5 million tons, as reduced coking coal consumption is offset by coal demand for industrial cogeneration. Coal consumption for electricity generation (exclud ing industrial cogeneration but including indepen dent power producers) rises from 847 million tons in 1995 to 1,039 million tons in 2015, due to increased utilization of existing generation capacity and, in later years, additions of new capacity. The average utilization rate for coal-fired power plants increases from 63 to 74 percent between 1995 and 2015. Coal consumption (in tons) per kilowatthour of generation is higher for subbituminous and lignite coals than for bituminous coal. Thus, the shift to western coal increases the tonnage per kilowatthour of generation in midwestern and southeastern regions. In the East, generators shift from higher to lower sulfur Appalachian bituminous coals that contain more energy (Btu) per short ton. Although coal maintains its fuel cost advantage over both oil and natural gas, gas-fired generation is the most economical choice for new power generation through 2010 when capital, operating, and fuel costs are considered. Between 2010 and 2015, rising natu ral gas costs and nuclear retirements are projected to cause increasing demand for coal-fired baseload capacity. In the non-electricity sectors, an increase of 18 million tons in industrial steam coal consumption between 1995 and 2015 (1.1-percent annual growth) is offset by a decrease of 13 million tons in coking coal consumption (Figure 106). Increasing consump tion of industrial steam coal results primarily from increased use of coal in the chemical and food processing industries and from increased use of coal for cogeneration (the production of both electricity and usable heat for industrial processes). The projected decline in domestic consumption of coking coal results from the displacement of raw steel production from integrated steel mills (which use coal coke for energy and as a material input) by increased production from minimills (which use elec tric arc furnaces that require no coal coke) and by increased imports of semi-finished steels. The amount of coke required per ton of pig iron produced is also declining, as process efficiency improves and injection of pulverized steam coal is used increasing ly in blast furnaces. Domestic consumption of coking coal is projected to fall by 2.4 percent a year through 2015. Domestic production of coking coal declines slightly faster, as consumption of imported coking coal continues its historical slow increase. While delivered energy consumption in the residen tial and commercial sectors grows by 0.8 percent and 0.9 percent a year, respectively, most of the growth is captured by electricity and natural gas. Coal con sumption in these sectors remains constant, account ing for less than 1 percent of total U.S. coal demand. 70",0
2009,"subsequent decline, with total pipeline imports in 2030 at the highest level among all the projections but still 0.6 trillion cubic feet below the 2007 level. Net LNG imports in the AEO2009 reference case are considerably lower than in any of the other projec tions, at less than 1.0 trillion cubic feet in 2030. EVA and IER are far more optimistic about the potential for increased LNG imports, with 2030 levels near 6 trillion cubic feet. Altos projects the highest level of LNG imports, at 11.0 trillion cubic feet in 2030, and IHSGI, DB, and SEER project more modest increases. U.S. domestic natural gas production increases through 2015 in all the projections except IER’s. SEER shows the highest production levels in 2015, at 22.1 trillion cubic feet. After 2015, only IHSGI and AEO2009 show domestic production continuing to in crease through 2030. The domestic production share of total natural gas supply in the AEO2009 reference case increases steadily, to more than 95 percent in 2030, as compared with the DB projection, which shows the domestic share consistent at around 80 percent. The other projections show declines in do mestic natural gas production from 2015 to 2030. IER has the lowest level in 2030, at 13.8 trillion cubic feet. In the EVA, IER, and Altos projections, domestic pro duction represents a much smaller share of total nat ural gas supply in 2030, at less than 70 percent. Natural gas wellhead prices in the United States, which were $6.39 per thousand cubic feet in 2007, in crease steadily in all the projections, with some excep tions in 2015. Altos, IER, and DB project higher average prices in 2030 than AEO2009. IHSGI, EVA, and SEER project lower prices than AEO2009. SEER and Altos also include lower domestic production lev els than the other projections. The highest wellhead price in 2030 is projected by Altos, at $10.13 per thou sand cubic feet. The lowest is projected by SEER, at $7.28 per thousand cubic feet. The price margins for delivered natural gas (the dif ference between delivered and wellhead prices) can vary significantly from year to year. In 2007, margins in the end-use sectors were notably higher than the historical average. In the AEO2009 reference case, margins in the electricity generation and industrial sectors generally decline over the projection period, whereas margins in the residential and commercial sectors generally rise, because fixed costs are spread over lower per-customer volumes as consumption is reduced by efficiency improvements. End-use prices in the IHSGI projection imply declin ing margins in all end-use sectors. The IER projec tions imply constant margins in all sectors except the industrial sector. In the SEER projection, margins re main relatively steady in the residential and indus trial sectors through 2030. The industrial sector margins in the SEER projection are approximately $0.40 per thousand cubic feet higher than those in the AEO2009 projection from 2015 to 2030, and those in the IER projection are about $1.65 per thousand cubic feet higher than in AEO2009. Margins in the electric ity generation sector are similar in the AEO2009 and IHSGI projections, and both are lower than in the IER and SEER projections.",1
2013,"Projections in the Annual Energy Outlook 2013 (AEO2013) are generated using the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) [148], developed and maintained by the Office of Energy Analysis of the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). In addition to its use in developing the Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) projections, NEMS is also used to complete analytical studies for the U.S. Congress, the Executive Office of the President, other offices within the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and other Federal agencies. NEMS is also used by other nongovernment groups, such as the Electric Power Research Institute, Duke University, and Georgia Institute of Technology. In addition, the AEO projections are used by analysts and planners in other government agencies and nongovernment organizations. The projections in NEMS are developed with the use of a market-based approach, subject to regulations and standards. For each fuel and consuming sector, NEMS balances energy supply and demand, accounting for economic competition among the various energy fuels and sources. The time horizon of NEMS extends to 2040. To represent regional differences in energy markets, the component modules of NEMS function at the regional level: the 9 Census divisions for the end-use demand modules; production regions specific to oil, natural gas, and coal supply and distribution; 22 regions and subregions of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation for electricity; and 9 refining regions that are a subset of the 5 Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts (PADDs). NEMS is organized and implemented as a modular system. The modules represent each of the fuel supply markets, conversion sectors, and end-use consumption sectors of the energy system. The modular design also permits the use of the methodology and level of detail most appropriate for each energy sector. NEMS executes each of the component modules to solve for prices of energy delivered to end users and the quantities consumed, by product, region, and sector. The delivered fuel prices encompass all the activities necessary to produce, import, and transport fuels to end users. The information flows also include such areas as economic activity, domestic production, and international petroleum supply. NEMS calls each supply, conversion, and end-use demand module in sequence until the delivered prices of energy and the quantities demanded have converged within tolerance, thus achieving an economic equilibrium of supply and demand in the consuming sectors. A solution is reached for each year from 2012 through 2040. Other variables, such as petroleum product imports, crude oil imports, and several macroeconomic indicators, also are evaluated for convergence. Each NEMS component represents the impacts and costs of legislation and environmental regulations that affect that sector. NEMS accounts for all energy-related carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions, as well as emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO ), nitrogen oxides (NO ), and mercury from the electricity generation sector. The version of NEMS used for AEO2013 generally represents current legislation and environmental regulations, including recent government actions for which implementing regulations were available as of September 30, 2012, as discussed in the “Legislation and regulations” section of the AEO. The potential impacts of proposed federal and state legislation, regulations, or standards—or of sections of legislation that have been enacted but require funds or implementing regulations that have not been provided or specified—are not reflected in NEMS. Many of the pending provisions, however, are examined in alternative cases included in AEO2013 or in other analysis completed by EIA. In general, the historical data presented with the AEO2013 projections are based on EIA’s Annual Energy Review 2011, published in September 2012 [149]; however, data were taken from multiple sources. In some cases, only partial or preliminary data were available for 2011. Historical numbers are presented for comparison only and may be estimates. Source documents should be consulted for the official data values. Footnotes to the AEO2013 appendix tables indicate the definitions and sources of historical data. Where possible, the AEO2013 projections for 2012 and 2013 incorporate short-term projections from EIA’s September 2012 Short Term Energy Outlook (STEO) [150]. EIA’s views regarding energy use over the 2012 through 2014 period are reported in monthly updates of the STEO [151], which should be considered to supersede information reported for those years in AEO2013.",2
1999,"Because analyses by the Energy Information Ad ministration (EIA) are required to be policy-neutral, the projections in this Annual Energy Outlook 1999 (AEO99) are based on Federal, State, and local laws and regulations in effect on July 1, 1998. The potential impacts of pending or proposed legislation and sections of existing legislation for which funds have not been appropriated are not reflected in the projections. Federal legislation incorporated in the projections includes the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which adds 4.3 cents per gallon to the Federal tax on highway fuels [1]; the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987; the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA90); the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT); the Outer Continental Shelf Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995; and the Tax Payer Relief Act of 1997. AEO99 also incorporates regulatory actions of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), including Orders 888 and 889, which provide open access to interstate transmis sion lines in electricity markets, and other FERC actions to foster more efficient natural gas markets. State plans for the restructuring of the electricity industry and State renewable portfolio standards are incorporated as enacted. CAAA90 requires a phased reduction in vehicle emissions of regulated pollutants, to be met pri marily through the use of reformulated gasoline. In addition, under CAAA90, annual emissions of sulfur dioxide by electricity generators are, in general, capped at 8.95 million short tons a year in 2010 and thereafter, although “banking” of allowances from earlier years is permitted. CAAA90 also calls for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue standards for the reduction of nitrogen oxide (NO ) emissions, leading to regulations that impose limits on electricity generators for NO emissions. The impacts of CAAA90 on electricity generators are discussed in “Market Trends” (see page 86). The provisions of EPACT focus primarily on reducing energy demand. It requires minimum building efficiency standards for Federal buildings and other new buildings that receive federally backed mortgages. Efficiency standards for electric motors, lights, and other equipment are required, and owners of fleets of automobiles and trucks are required to phase in vehicles that do not rely on petroleum products. The projections include only those equipment standards for which final actions have been taken and which specify efficiency levels, including the refrigerator standard that goes into effect in July 2001. AEO98 included a discussion of proposed actions, but no additional standards have been finalized.",3
2004,"AEO2004 projects additions of 23 gigawatts of new nonhydroelectric renewable generating capacity from 2002 to 2025, including 18 gigawatts in the electric power sector, 4 gigawatts in combined heat and power, and 1 gigawatt in small-scale end-use applica tions. In the electric power sector, 3.1 gigawatts of new capacity is projected as a result of State man dates (wind power 1.9 gigawatts, geothermal 0.7 gigawatts, biomass 0.3 gigawatts, landfill gas 0.2 gigawatts, and solar photovoltaic plus thermal, 0.1 gigawatts) and the rest from commercial projects (Figure 79). The commercial projects include 0.08 gigawatts of central-station solar thermal and 0.3 gigawatts of grid-connected central-station photovol taic capacity that is assumed to be built for testing, demonstration, environmental, and other reasons. In the reference case, a number of States with man dates and renewable portfolio standards are projected to add significant amounts of renewable capacity after 2002. They include California (1,210 mega watts), Minnesota (921 megawatts), Nevada (470 megawatts), Pennsylvania (95 megawatts, built in West Virginia), Texas (270 megawatts), New Mexico (205 megawatts), and Massachusetts (175 mega watts). Other States with smaller requirements include Arizona, Connecticut, Illinois, and Wisconsin. Most identified new capacity is expected to be con structed in the near term—43 percent by 2003 and two-thirds by 2006. Because the Federal production tax credit for wind plants is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2003, 1,664 megawatts (58 percent) of currently planned new wind capacity is projected to be built before the end of 2003. The low renewables case assumes that the cost and performance characteristics for key nonhydropower renewable energy technologies remain fixed at cur rent levels; the high renewables case assumes cost reductions of 10 percent on a site-specific basis [113]; the DOE goals case assumes lower capital costs, higher capacity factors, and lower operating costs, based on the renewable energy goals of the U.S. Department of Energy [114]. In each case, assump tions for nonrenewable technologies are the same as in the reference case. In the low renewables case, construction of new renewable capacity is considerably lower than pro jected in the reference case (Figure 80). In the high renewables case, additions of geothermal, biomass, and wind capacity are substantially higher than pro jected in the reference case, with most of the incre mental capacity added between 2010 and 2025; however, nonhydropower renewables remain rela tively small contributors to total generation, at 139 billion kilowatthours (3.1 percent of the total) in 2010 and 334 billion kilowatthours (5.7 percent) in 2025. In the DOE goals case, still more wind and geother mal generating capacity is projected to be added. Geo thermal electricity generation in 2010 is lower in the DOE goals case than in the reference case, but in 2025 it is almost double the reference case projection, at 90 billion kilowatthours, or approximately 1.6 percent of total generation. Generation from wind power in 2010 is 29 percent higher in the DOE goals case, at 31 billion kilowatthours, than in the reference case, and in 2025 it is more than six times higher, at 331 billion kilowatthours or 5.7 percent of total generation. 86",4
2003,"in the South Atlantic region is $3.67 per thousand cubic feet. LNG facility trigger prices are estimated by adding liquefaction, transportation, and regasification costs to overseas production costs. The AEO2003 regional trigger prices at which new U.S.-based LNG facilities are expected to become economical range from $3.79 to $4.64 per thousand cubic feet (Table 3). The costs for new LNG facilities include $0.45 to $0.87 per thousand cubic feet for regasification, with produc tion, liquefaction, and shipping costs accounting for the remainder (Table 4). These estimates do not include any provision for technological progress, because it is assumed that increases in production costs would offset decreases in other areas resulting from technological progress. Regasification costs at existing terminals are lower, at an estimated average of $0.16 per thousand cubic feet. The regional trigger prices for capacity expan sions at existing LNG facilities are expected to be in the range of $3.31 to $3.51 per thousand cubic feet. Regasification costs for expansion beyond currently announced or proposed levels at existing terminals are estimated to range from $0.16 to $0.35 per thou sand cubic feet. In addition to cost, there are many other uncertain ties for LNG projects. For example, there is the risk that a project would not be permitted and licensed in a timely fashion, increasing construction costs and delaying additions to lower 48 gas supplies. Local opposition to an LNG terminal could preclude and/or delay construction. Another risk includes the coordi nation of overseas LNG supplies, LNG tankers, and the construction of domestic terminals so that they are all ready for operation at the same time. Finally, there is uncertainty about the interaction of various potential projects. The total volumes repre sented by all the proposed projects would be a signifi cant portion of total U.S. gas supply and therefore could affect market prices. A decline in wellhead nat ural gas prices resulting from the introduction of additional supplies from one of the sources, such as an Alaskan pipeline, could make other choices uneco nomical. This uncertainty applies not only to compe tition between pipeline and LNG projects but also to competition among individual pipelines or LNG terminals. In the AEO2003 reference case, future natural gas prices are projected to be sufficient to make the con struction of both the Alaskan and MacKenzie Delta pipelines economical, as well as expanded and new LNG facilities (Figure 20). The high and low eco nomic growth cases illustrate the degree of variability in the results given varying assumptions. The two alternate cases show the impacts of higher and lower levels of demand on natural gas prices and, in turn, the viability of new supply projects (Table 5). In the low economic growth case, total projected consump tion of natural gas in 2025 is 31.8 trillion cubic feet, and only one new LNG facility is expected, coming into service in 2025. In the high economic growth case, with consumption projected at 37.5 trillion cubic feet in 2025, all three new supply sources come into play, with MacKenzie Delta gas beginning to flow in 2014, gas from new LNG facilities becoming available 42 in 2013, and gas from an Alaskan pipeline first reach ing the lower 48 States in 2018. In both the reference and high economic growth cases, domestic supplies and Canadian imports are expected to be sufficient to meet demands through the first half of the forecast period. By 2010, prices are expected to reach levels that begin to trigger the introduction of new supply sources. Beginning in 2016 in the reference case, the MacKenzie Delta pipe line and new LNG terminals begin to play a role in meeting growing demands for natural gas, with gas from an Alaskan pipeline beginning to contribute in 2021. In the high economic growth case, gas from the MacKenzie Delta and new LNG terminals becomes available in 2014, 2 years earlier than in the reference case, and the Alaskan pipeline begins to deliver gas in 2018. Although the general pattern is for prices to recede with the introduction of supplies from any one of these new sources, demand growth is strong enough that prices fall back slightly for only a short period before beginning to increase again and trigger either expansion at the new source or the activation of an additional source of supply. For example, in the high economic growth case, natural gas wellhead prices generally grow steadily from $2.97 in 2005 to $3.77 in",5
2002,"Net energy delivered to consumers represents only a part of total primary energy consumption. Primary consumption includes energy losses associated with the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity, which are allocated to the end-use sectors (residential, commercial, and industrial) in propor tion to each sector’s share of electricity use [77]. How energy consumption is measured has become more important over time, as reliance on electricity has expanded. In 1970, electricity accounted for only 12 percent of energy delivered to the end-use sectors, excluding transportation. Since then, the growth in electricity use for applications such as space condi tioning, consumer appliances, telecommunication equipment, and industrial machinery has resulted in greater divergence between primary and delivered energy consumption (Figure 23). This trend is expected to stabilize in the forecast, as more efficient generating technologies offset increased demand for electricity. Projected primary energy consumption and delivered energy consumption both grow by 1.2 percent per year, excluding transportation use. At the end-use sectoral level, tracking of primary energy consumption is necessary to link specific policies with overall goals. Carbon dioxide emis sions, for example, are closely correlated with total energy consumption. In the development of carbon dioxide stabilization policies, growth rates for pri mary energy consumption may be more important than those for delivered energy. Energy intensity, both as measured by primary energy consumption per dollar of GDP and as mea sured on a per capita basis, declined between 1970 and the mid-1980s (Figure 24). Although the overall GDP-based energy intensity of the economy is pro jected to continue declining between 2000 and 2020, the decline is not expected to be as rapid as it was in the earlier period. GDP is estimated to increase by almost 80 percent between 2000 and 2020, compared with a 32-percent increase in primary energy use. Relatively stable energy prices are expected to slow the decline in energy intensity, as is increased use of electricity-based energy services. When electricity claims a greater share of energy use, consumption of primary energy per dollar of GDP declines at a slower rate, because electricity use contributes both end-use consumption and energy losses to total energy consumption. In the AEO2002 forecast, the demand for energy services is projected to increase markedly over 2000 levels. The average home in 2020 is expected to be 6.5 percent larger and to use electricity more inten sively. Annual personal highway travel and air travel per capita in 2020 are expected to be 31 per cent and 68 percent higher, respectively, than in 2000. With the growth in demand for energy ser vices, primary energy intensity on a per capita basis is projected to increase by 0.6 percent per year through 2020, with efficiency improvements in many end-use energy applications making it possible to provide higher levels of service without significant increases in total energy use per capita. 61",6
2020,"• Total delivered energy consumption in the U.S. buildings sector grows slowly through the AEO2020 Reference case projection period, 2019 to 2050, by 0.2% per year, as energy efficiency improvements, increases in distributed electricity generation, and regional shifts in the population partially offset the impacts of higher growth rates in population, number of households, and commercial floorspace. • Purchased electricity consumption grows in both the residential and commercial sectors as a result of increased demand for appliances, devices, and equipment that use electricity. In the Reference case, purchased electricity increases by 0.6% and 0.8% per year in the residential and commercial sectors, respectively, through 2050. • Natural gas consumption by commercial buildings grows by 0.2% per year through the projection period, led by increases in water heating and cooking. Consumption of natural gas in the residential sector falls by 0.3% per year as its use for space heating continues to decline. • If not for the contribution of distributed generation sources, particularly rooftop solar, purchased electricity consumption in residential and commercial buildings would be 5% and 3% higher, respectively, by the end of the projection period. #AEO2020 www.eia.gov/aeo",7
2009,"Background Oil shales are fine-grained sedimentary rocks that contain relatively large amounts of kerogen, which can be converted into liquid and gaseous hydrocar bons (petroleum liquids, natural gas liquids, and methane) by heating the rock, usually in the absence of oxygen, to 650 to 700 degrees Fahrenheit (in situ retorting) or 900 to 950 degrees Fahrenheit (surface retorting) [60]. (“Oil shale” is, strictly speaking, a misnomer in that the rock is not necessarily a shale and contains no crude oil.) The richest U.S. oil shale deposits are located in Northwest Colorado, Northeast Utah, and Southwest Wyoming (Table 10). Currently, those deposits are the focus of petroleum industry research and potential future production.",8
2005,"The different paths projected for total U.S. crude oil production in the three world oil price cases reflect differences both in the numbers of new fields devel oped and in the volumes of oil recovered from existing fields. Total U.S. oil production is only marginally sensitive to crude oil price projections (Figure 92), both because future production is expected to come largely from developed fields, such as Prudhoe Bay, and because development of much of the remaining oil resource base (Table 30) would be uneconomical even with much higher oil prices. In the high A and low world oil price cases, total U.S. production in 2025 is projected at 5.2 and 4.5 million barrels per day, respectively. The different price paths in the three cases primarily affect the development and production of lower 48 off shore resources (Table 31). Smaller deepwater fields that are not profitable when prices are low are expected to become profitable at higher price levels. Lower 48 crude oil production is projected to reach 4.4 and 3.9 million barrels per day in 2025 in the rapid and slow technology cases, respectively, compared with 4.1 million barrels per day in the reference case (Figure 93). The technology cases assume the same world oil prices as in the reference case, but the rate of technological progress is assumed to be 50 percent higher (in the rapid technology case) or lower (in the slow technology case) than the historical rate. With domestic oil demand determined largely by oil prices and economic growth rates, consumption is not expected to change significantly in the technology cases. Thus, changes in production resulting from the different rates of technological progress lead to differ ent projected levels of petroleum imports. In 2025, net petroleum imports are projected to range from 18.5 million barrels per day in the rapid technology case to 19.6 million barrels per day in the slow tech nology case, as compared with 19.1 million barrels per day in the reference case. In the lower 48 States, offshore crude oil production is more sensitive than onshore production to changes in technology, because there are more opportunities for technological improvement in the less mature areas offshore, particularly in the deepwater Gulf of Mex ico. Cumulative offshore production from 2004 through 2025 is projected to be 0.7 billion barrels (4.0 percent) higher in the rapid technology case and 0.8 billion barrels (4.7 percent) lower in the slow technol ogy case than in the reference case. Cumulative onshore production is about 0.4 billion barrels (2.0 percent) higher in the rapid oil and gas technology case and 0.4 billion barrels (1.8 percent) lower in the slow technology case than in the reference case. 100",9
